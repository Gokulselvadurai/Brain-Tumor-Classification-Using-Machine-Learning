# Brain Tumor Classification Using Machine Learning
- Acquired Brain MRI images from IEEE DataPort to develop a deep learning-based classification model.
- Implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Python libraries, including TensorFlow and Keras.
- Designed and integrated custom layers into the proposed model and benchmarked it against pre-trained models.
- Fine-tuned the models and evaluated their effectiveness using performance metrics, including the confusion matrix.
