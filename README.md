# Brain Tumor Classification Using Machine Learning

- Utilized IEEE DataPort to obtain Brain MRI images for the development of a deep learning-based classification model.

- Built a CNN model using Python libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras.  

- Designed custom layers for the proposed model and evaluated it against pre-trained models.  

- Fine-tuned the models and compared their effectiveness and performance using a confusion matrix.
