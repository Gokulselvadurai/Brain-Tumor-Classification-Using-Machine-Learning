# Brain-Tumor-Classification-Using-Machine-Learning
• Utilized IEEE DataPort to obtain Brain MRI images for the development of deep learning based classification model.
• Built an CNN model using python libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras.
• Designed custom layers for proposed model and evaluated it with pre-trained models.
• After fine-tuning this models, the effectiveness and performance was compared with the help of confusion matrix.
